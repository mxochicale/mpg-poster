* Come to see my poster entitled: 
"eMOTION: Analysis of Emotion and Movement Variability in the Context of Human-Robot Interaction"
for the MPG Student Prize Award today from 18h00m at @AstonUniversity



* This evening, I am presenting some advances of my scientific endeavours 
with the use of nonlinear dynamics to analyse emotion and movement variability in 
the context of human-robot interaction.
See you in a bit at the MPG Student Prize Award (18h00m-21h00m) at @AstonUniversity.
