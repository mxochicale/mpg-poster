2018 MPG Annual Student Poster Evening & Prize Giving [:link:](https://communities.theiet.org/communities/events/item/154/336/19829)
---

# DESCRIPTION
Each year the Midlands Power Group holds a student poster event 
open to students from Midlands Universities. The event provides 
an opportunity for both undergraduates and postgraduates to showcase 
their work to members of the MPG, business and other universities. 
This year, Aston University has kindly agreed to host the event 
which will be held in the Great Hall of the university.
The event provides an opportunity for students to present their work 
to judges and to their peers, to field questions on their work and 
to share the fruits of their hard work with members of the engineering 
community. The culmination of the event is a prize giving to those 
students deemed to be 'best in class'.

Subject: MPG Student Prize Giving Event - 7 March 2018

Dear All,
   The IET Midlands Power Group has organised again the Prize Award Evening 
for the 7th of March 2018. This year the location is Aston University in Birmingham city centre.
This event, open to both undergraduate and postgraduate students, is an exciting opportunity 
to present your research project to industrial people, academics and fellow students 
from other Universities in the West Midlands.
Each student will need to produce a poster design (A1 or A2 size) and present their project 
to the judging team. Prizes will be awarded by the IET and industry for the categories 
of undergraduate and postgraduate students.
Over the recent years, the University of Birmingham has been quite successful in 
winning prizes in both categories, so I warmly encourage you to come to this event.
Please reply to this email if you are interested by the 28th of February, 
indicating the title of the project you are intending to present.
Looking forward to hearing from you.
Kind regards,
Pietro

## CRITERIO OF EVALUATION

The project is evaluated according to several criteria, including novelty of 
the research, potential for impact, potential for applications to future 
products/services, benefits to industry and/or general public.
My suggestion is to highlight these aspects, rather than focussing only on 
the technical aspects of your project, which might be difficult to grasp 
from non-experts. The judges will all be engineers but they will come 
from a variety of backgrounds.

Dear All,
  Many thanks for attending the IET MPG Prize Awards yesterday. 
Your contribution has been determinant for the success of the 
event and I was impressed by the quality of the 
research carried out in our Department.
Congratulations to Rana for winning one of the prizes and thanks 
to all of you for your participation. 
I hope you enjoyed the evening as much as I did.
Best wishes,
Pietro

## RAW COMMENTS OF MY PARTICIPATION 

This is my first time in participating in the Midlands Power Group Poster Award,
I had a good experience when presenting my work to two judges with Engineering backgrounds
(none of them in robotics or computer science). 

One of the questions that still make echo in my head is what is the hardest part of 
creating and conducting experiments in the context of human-robot interaction, so my 
answer was simple: "the mathematical foundation to provide scientific evidence of the measurement
of movement variability". The judges also questioned me about my next goal in my 
research something like long term goal and my answer was simple:
"use deep learning to automatically measure movement variability and the make impact 
in areas such as rehabilitation, elderly care, child-robot interaction, sport science, 
entertainment to mention but a few."
I did not get any price but the exercise of sharing my ideas and be judges 
by engineers of 30 to 40 years of experience was very valuable. Specially,
as I explain what I do to other people, my thoughts in some way reorganise themselves 
and refine my explanations and make a clear and simple point of the things
that I am doing can contribute to the creation of a better world.
