2018 MPG Annual Student Poster Evening & Prize Giving [:link:](https://communities.theiet.org/communities/events/item/154/336/19829)
---

# DESCRIPTION
Each year the Midlands Power Group holds a student poster event 
open to students from Midlands Universities. The event provides 
an opportunity for both undergraduates and postgraduates to showcase 
their work to members of the MPG, business and other universities. 
This year, Aston University has kindly agreed to host the event 
which will be held in the Great Hall of the university.
The event provides an opportunity for students to present their work 
to judges and to their peers, to field questions on their work and 
to share the fruits of their hard work with members of the engineering 
community. The culmination of the event is a prize giving to those 
students deemed to be 'best in class'.

## CRITERIO OF EVALUATION

The project is evaluated according to several criteria, including novelty of 
the research, potential for impact, potential for applications to future 
products/services, benefits to industry and/or general public.
My suggestion is to highlight these aspects, rather than focussing only on 
the technical aspects of your project, which might be difficult to grasp 
from non-experts. The judges will all be engineers but they will come 
from a variety of backgrounds.
