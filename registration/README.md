Criterios of evaluation for MPG poster competition

Dear Bob

I have registered myself for the MPG poster competition with the PROJECT TITLE: 
"eMOTION: Analysis of Emotion and Movement Variability in the Context of Human-Robot Interaction"
by replying the invitation of Pietro Tricoli at University of Birmingham.

I am wondering if there are any general requirements for the poster
and also the criteria of evaluation for the judging team.

Regards,
Miguel
